# PortfolioPresentation
This presentation was for a project in my data analytics class at American University that I took while pursuing my Master's degree.
We were asked to analyze a dataset, constructing visualizations to make the information more accessible to a wider audience.
I used the LatinoBarometro 2023 report to analyze the effects of political leanings on support for democracy and military rule, as well as differences in preference by country.
